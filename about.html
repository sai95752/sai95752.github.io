    <p class="text">The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national, non-profit organization of middle and high school students who are engage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) that enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities. Regardlessof previous experience, members continue to build upon key team building, time management, problem solving, and organizational skills. Although a relatively new club at Amador, TSA is becoming increasingly popular among many students who are interested in STEM fields. Club members meet every other Wednesday and outside of school to work on their events and communicate with officers as well as discuss information regarding upcoming TSA conferences. Visit the California State TSA or the National TSA websites. TSA members are given the opportunity to select from a list of events to compete in, either individually or as a group. Teams will work on researching their topics and addressing the event's written prompt and brief, documenting their work in detail along the way. Members can work during meetings, during class, or outside of school to prepare for up to six events. After teams have had time to work with their teams on their respective projects, chapters will hold club-wide competitions to decide which teams advance to their state's regional competition. At regionals, teams from other chapters will compete, presenting their work or participating in events at regionals to panels of professional judges and teachers. The finalists of regionals proceed to TSA nationals, where the best-performing individuals and teams will compete in their events. This year, our chapter hosted regional conferences for Northern California and several of our members will be attending TSA Nationals in Washington D.C.</p>
