        <h1>Intro to Engineering Design - PLTW</h1>
        <h5>The first course in the program, generally necessary as a prerequisite for more advanced
          Engineering</h5>
        <p>This course is intended to serve as a foundation course within the Project Lead the Way course
          sequence. Students will learn how to take an idea through a design process that will eventually be
          manufactured or produced, as well as how to apply various aspects of engineering and engineering
          design to activities, projects, and problems. This course covers The Role of an Engineer, The Design
          Process, Product Design, Product Analysis and Improvement, and Designing as an Engineer. Students
          use Inventor, a state of the art 3-D design software package to help design solutions to different
          projects.</p>

        <h1>Principles of Engineering Design - PLTW, ROP</h1>
        <h5>The second course in the project lead the way engineering program, available after completion of the first course.
</h5>
        <p>Students learn to employ critical thinking, creativity, innovation, and engineering concepts in the
           solution of engineering-design problems. This course follows a proven hands-on, real-world
           problem-solving approach to learning. Studentsare given the opportunity to investigate engineering
           and high-tech careers, as well to apply  knowledge of research and design to create solutions to
            various challenges. Students use industry-recognized 3D modeling software and design, test,and
            construct device-think machines and robotics.
